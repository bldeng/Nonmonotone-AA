This is the code for the TV image deconvolution example. The code is based on the source code released in https://www.caam.rice.edu/~optimization/L1/ftvd/v4.1/. 

Our implementation of LM-AA can be found in LM_AA.m. 

To use the code, just run the script "comparison_w.m" then the figures and data will be generated in the current folder. We have used processing_figure.m to generate the figures used in the paper.
